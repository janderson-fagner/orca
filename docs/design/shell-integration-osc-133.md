# Design: Shell Integration via OSC 133

**Issue:** #1165 (to be retitled)
**Branch:** `brennanb2025/foreground-process-agent-exit` (to be renamed to match PR title)
**PR title:** `feat(terminal): OSC 133 shell integration for zsh + PowerShell (behind flag)`
**Author:** Brennan Benson
**Status:** Approved for implementation (trimmed scope, 2026-04-27)

## Problem

The renderer maintains an `agentStatusByPaneKey` map of live agent turns (Codex, Claude, Gemini, OpenCode, cursor-agent, etc.) that powers the agent dashboard. Agent CLIs fire hooks for state transitions, but **none of them fire a hook when the user Ctrl+Cs out of the agent back to the shell** — the SIGINT kills the agent too fast for it to emit anything. This leaves a stale dashboard row until its 30-minute TTL decays.

We currently have a branch (`brennanb2025/foreground-process-agent-exit`) that solves this by polling node-pty's `proc.process` on a 2s cadence. On POSIX this works — node-pty calls `tcgetpgrp` on the PTY master fd, which returns the process-group leader currently owning the terminal foreground (a kernel-maintained primitive for job control). When the agent dies and the shell reclaims the foreground, the poller fires a `pty:foreground-shell` IPC event and the renderer drops the row.

**This does not work on Windows.** ConPTY has no concept of foreground-process-group ownership; there is no `tcgetpgrp` equivalent, no kernel-maintained notion of "which process owns the terminal's input right now," and node-pty's Windows implementation of `proc.process` returns a static string set at spawn time. **Approximately 50% of our users are on Windows.** Shipping a Unix-only fix leaves half the user base on the 30-minute TTL indefinitely.

Every serious terminal emulator (VS Code, Windows Terminal, Warp, WezTerm, Tabby, Ghostty) has converged on the same cross-platform solution: **shell integration via OSC escape sequences**. The shell emits `OSC 133;A` (prompt start), `;B` (prompt end / command start), `;C` (command executed), `;D;<exit_code>` (command finished) out-of-band in the PTY byte stream. The terminal app parses these from the same data stream it is already rendering. No kernel primitive, no platform-specific PTY APIs — the shell *volunteers* the information.

This is a **cross-platform mechanism by construction**: OSC sequences are just bytes in the PTY stream, and every shell we care about has a prompt hook (`precmd`, `PROMPT_COMMAND`, `PSConsoleHostReadLine`, `fish_prompt`) that can emit them. The work is per-shell, not per-OS.

**Reference implementations (both checked out locally):**
- VS Code: `/Users/thebr/source/repos/public/vscode/src/vs/platform/terminal/common/xterm/shellIntegrationAddon.ts` — the canonical xterm.js addon for OSC 133/633 parsing. Ships injection scripts for bash, zsh, fish, PowerShell at `src/vs/workbench/contrib/terminal/common/scripts/`.
- Ghostty: `/Users/thebr/source/repos/public/ghostty/src/terminal/osc/parsers/semantic_prompt.zig` — the OSC 133 parser. Shell scripts at `/Users/thebr/source/repos/public/ghostty/src/shell-integration/` (one per shell: bash, zsh, fish, elvish, nushell).

## Scope

**In scope (this design):**
- Adopt OSC 133 as the primary shell-integration protocol (FinalTerm-pioneered, iTerm2-adopted, widely supported).
- Ship injection scripts for **zsh** and **PowerShell** only. Extend the existing shell-ready wrapper infrastructure (`src/main/providers/local-pty-shell-ready.ts`, `src/main/daemon/shell-ready.ts`) rather than building a parallel injection system.
- Parse OSC 133 sequences in the renderer (xterm.js v6 via `parser.registerOscHandler`). Parser lives on the renderer only (Option A).
- **Delete** `agent-foreground-poller.ts` + its IPC plumbing in the same PR. Replace with a renderer-local handler that drops `agentStatusByPaneKey` entries on `OSC 133;D`.
- Gated behind the existing compile-time `AGENT_DASHBOARD_ENABLED` constant only. The runtime `experimentalAgentTracking` user toggle is a follow-up PR that lands before `AGENT_DASHBOARD_ENABLED` flips to `true` at release.
- Graceful fallback: users with broken/missing injection fall back to the existing 30-minute TTL + renderer decay-to-idle.
- **Windows feature parity** — PowerShell on Windows lights up the same way zsh does on macOS.

**Out of scope (explicit follow-up PRs):**
- bash, fish, cmd.exe, nushell, elvish injection.
- OSC 633 parsing (including `633;E` command-line capture).
- Parsing in the daemon's headless emulator (Option B — not chosen; renderer-only parsing is simpler and matches VS Code).
- Remote PTYs (SSH). Injection would need to happen on the remote side.
- Exit-code-aware UX (failed-command badges, re-run shortcuts), command navigation, telemetry counters, and diagnostic "shell integration inactive" UI. This design only uses `OSC 133;D` to *drop* a stale dashboard row.
- Consolidation of `local-pty-shell-ready.ts` + `daemon/shell-ready.ts`.
- Tri-state (auto / always-on) feature flag and graduation-to-default machinery.
- Agent-status hook replacement. We keep the existing per-agent hooks (Claude/Codex/Gemini/OpenCode/Cursor) for state entry; shell integration only solves the "agent exited, nobody said so" gap.

## Existing Architecture

### What already works in our favor

This codebase is further along than a greenfield OSC 133 project would be. The key existing surfaces:

| Component | File | What it gives us |
|-----------|------|------------------|
| Shell-ready wrapper (local) | `src/main/providers/local-pty-shell-ready.ts` | Injects a wrapper `.zshenv` / `.zshrc` / `.zlogin` (via `ZDOTDIR`) and `--rcfile` bash rcfile. Already emits `OSC 133;A` from `precmd` / `PROMPT_COMMAND` when `ORCA_SHELL_READY_MARKER=1`. |
| Shell-ready wrapper (daemon) | `src/main/daemon/shell-ready.ts` | Parallel implementation for the daemon-forked PTY path. |
| Shell-ready wrapper files (on disk) | `~/Library/Application Support/orca/shell-ready/zsh/{.zshenv,.zshrc,.zlogin,.zprofile}`, `.../bash/rcfile` | Regenerated from template at app launch by `ensureShellReadyWrappers()`. We already own the injection point. |
| Headless emulator (daemon) | `src/main/daemon/headless-emulator.ts`, `src/main/daemon/session.ts` | `@xterm/headless` instance that parses every byte the daemon receives. Already scans for `\x1b]777;orca-shell-ready\x07` to gate startup-command flush. |
| xterm.js in renderer | `src/renderer/src/components/terminal-pane/pty-connection.ts` (+ siblings) | Full xterm.js v6 with `parser.registerOscHandler` API. |
| Agent-status IPC path | `src/main/index.ts:272` (`pty:foreground-shell`), `src/preload/index.ts:343` | Existing wire for "drop this pane's dashboard row." Shell integration can re-use it. |
| Agent-status teardown | `registerPaneKeyTeardownListener` in `src/main/index.ts:280` | Fires when the PTY itself dies. No change needed. |

### What's missing

1. **Shell emission.** The wrappers emit only `OSC 133;A` today, and only when the one-shot ready flag is set. We need `OSC 133;C` (command start) and `OSC 133;D;<exit>` (command end) persistently across the pane's lifetime — not just at first prompt. (OSC 133 emission is a different signal from the existing one-shot shell-ready marker; both live in the same wrapper file for now but could be extracted later.)
2. **PowerShell wrapper.** Zero Windows coverage today; the shell-ready infrastructure currently `return`s early on `win32`. We need a PowerShell `$PROFILE` injection path.
3. **Parsing.** Nothing parses OSC 133 sub-sequences A/B/C/D. The daemon emulator scans for the `orca-shell-ready` string marker but not for general OSC 133.
4. **Renderer consumer.** `agent-foreground-poller.ts` and the `pty:foreground-shell` IPC exist but are driven by polling `tcgetpgrp`, which works on POSIX only — and are being deleted in this PR.

### Current foreground-poller branch (deleted in this PR)

The `brennanb2025/foreground-process-agent-exit` branch adds a 2s-interval poller, a `getForegroundProcess` RPC through `SubprocessHandle` → `Session` → `TerminalHost` → `DaemonServer` → `DaemonPtyAdapter`, and the `pty:foreground-shell` IPC + preload binding + renderer `useIpcEvents` handler.

All of it is **deleted in the same commit series that lands shell integration**. Net diff is negative before the new code lands. See the [Deletion checklist](#migration-from-the-current-branch) below.

## Design

### 1. Protocol: OSC 133 only

We emit and parse the FinalTerm OSC 133 quartet:

| Sequence | Meaning | When the shell emits it |
|----------|---------|-------------------------|
| `OSC 133;A ST` | Prompt start | Top of `precmd` / `PROMPT_COMMAND` — the shell is about to print the prompt. |
| `OSC 133;B ST` | Prompt end / command input start | End of `precmd` — the user can type now. |
| `OSC 133;C ST` | Command executed | `preexec` — user hit Enter; command starts running now. |
| `OSC 133;D;<exit> ST` | Command finished | Next `precmd` fire — previous command's `$?` captured and embedded. |

Where `ST` is either `\x07` (BEL) or `\x1b\x5c` (ESC `\`). We emit BEL because it's shorter and VS Code / Ghostty / iTerm2 all accept it.

**Why 133 and not 633:** 133 is older, more widely adopted, and matches what tmux/iTerm2/Kitty/Ghostty already interoperate with. 633 is Microsoft-specific and adds nothing we need for drop-on-exit; revisit only when a follow-up feature needs `633;E` command-line capture.

### 2. Shell injection plan

We extend `local-pty-shell-ready.ts` and `daemon/shell-ready.ts` (consolidation deferred). Each shell gets a dedicated hook set that emits A/C/D on every prompt, not just the first.

#### 2a. zsh

Extend `~/.../shell-ready/zsh/.zshrc` to register precmd + preexec:

```zsh
# OSC 133 shell integration (on top of existing shell-ready logic)
__orca_osc133_precmd() {
  local exit_code=$?
  # Emit D for the previous command (if any), then A/B for the next prompt
  if [[ -n "${__orca_in_command:-}" ]]; then
    printf '\e]133;D;%s\a' "$exit_code"
    unset __orca_in_command
  fi
  printf '\e]133;A\a'
}
__orca_osc133_preexec() {
  printf '\e]133;C\a'
  __orca_in_command=1
}
# Prepend: any prior precmd clobbers $?, so we must read it first.
# Matches VS Code's shellIntegration-rc.zsh.
precmd_functions=(__orca_osc133_precmd $precmd_functions)
preexec_functions=(__orca_osc133_preexec $preexec_functions)
```

The existing `orca-shell-ready` marker (OSC 777) stays for the startup-command barrier — it's a different signal (one-shot startup vs. per-prompt lifecycle) and removing it would regress the "claude claude" double-echo fix.

`133;B` (prompt end) is omitted for zsh because zsh prompts are strings, not function-generated — emitting B would require wrapping `$PS1` with escape sequences, and neither VS Code nor Ghostty bother for zsh. The parser treats `B` as optional.

#### 2b. PowerShell (Windows)

This is the **new infrastructure** — there is no PowerShell path in the current wrapper system.

**On-disk path:** `${app.getPath('userData')}/shell-ready/pwsh/orca-shell-integration.ps1` (mirrors the existing zsh/bash wrapper root; both `local-pty-shell-ready.ts` and `daemon/shell-ready.ts` write their own copy until consolidation). LF line endings are fine — PowerShell parses LF-terminated scripts correctly and we do not sign them.

**Script content:**

```powershell
# OSC 133 shell integration for PowerShell
# Authoritative reference: VS Code's shellIntegration.ps1.

# Why source $PROFILE here (not from the -Command line): users commonly rebind
# $function:prompt from $PROFILE (oh-my-posh, starship, posh-git). If we
# captured $function:prompt BEFORE $PROFILE ran, our wrapper would call the
# stock prompt, not the user's customized one. Loading $PROFILE first and
# capturing after means we wrap what the user actually sees.
if (Test-Path $PROFILE) {
    # Swallow errors so a broken $PROFILE does not disable the drop signal.
    # The user still sees the error via PowerShell's default handling.
    try { . $PROFILE } catch { Write-Error $_ }
}

$Global:__OrcaInCommand = $false
$Global:__OrcaOriginalPrompt = $function:prompt
function Global:prompt {
    # Capture FIRST — any other expression clobbers $? and may reset $LASTEXITCODE.
    $lastExit = $LASTEXITCODE
    $lastOk = $?
    $exitCode = if ($null -ne $lastExit) { $lastExit } elseif ($lastOk) { 0 } else { 1 }
    if ($Global:__OrcaInCommand) {
        [Console]::Write("`e]133;D;$exitCode`a")
        $Global:__OrcaInCommand = $false
    }
    [Console]::Write("`e]133;A`a")
    $result = & $Global:__OrcaOriginalPrompt
    [Console]::Write("`e]133;B`a")
    $result
}

# Hook command execution via PSReadLine.
# Known limitation: this overwrites any user-bound Enter handler. A future PR
# should `Get-PSReadLineKeyHandler -Key Enter` first and skip registration (or
# chain) if the user has already customized Enter. Shipping the overwrite now
# because (a) the default AcceptLine binding is what 99% of users have, and
# (b) missing OSC 133;C only degrades the shell-integration feature to "D-only"
# in that session — the drop signal still fires from the prompt wrapper.
if (Get-Module PSReadLine) {
    Set-PSReadLineKeyHandler -Key Enter -ScriptBlock {
        [Console]::Write("`e]133;C`a")
        $Global:__OrcaInCommand = $true
        [Microsoft.PowerShell.PSConsoleReadLine]::AcceptLine()
    }
}
```

**Launch invocation:** `pwsh.exe -NoLogo -NoProfile -NoExit -Command ". '<abs-path-to-orca-shell-integration.ps1>'"`. `-NoProfile` prevents PowerShell from auto-loading `$PROFILE` at startup; the integration script loads it explicitly, in the correct order. Absolute path to the `.ps1` is resolved once in `getWrappedShellLaunchConfig` (see §2c Launch wiring) and embedded directly into the `-Command` string — no `$env:ORCA_SHELL_INTEGRATION` indirection needed.

#### 2c. Launch wiring

Both `src/main/providers/local-pty-shell-ready.ts:199` and `src/main/daemon/shell-ready.ts:161` already have a `getWrappedShellLaunchConfig(shellPath, options)` function that returns `{ args, env, supportsReadyMarker }`. Today it handles `zsh` and `bash` and falls through to `{ args: null, env: {}, supportsReadyMarker: false }` for everything else — meaning PowerShell currently launches with no wrapping. The same function gains a new branch in both files:

```ts
const pwshNames = new Set(['pwsh', 'pwsh.exe', 'powershell', 'powershell.exe'])
if (pwshNames.has(shellName)) {
  ensureShellReadyWrappers()  // extend this helper to also write the .ps1 on win32
  const scriptPath = `${getShellReadyWrapperRoot()}/pwsh/orca-shell-integration.ps1`
  return {
    args: ['-NoLogo', '-NoProfile', '-NoExit', '-Command', `. '${scriptPath.replace(/'/g, "''")}'`],
    env: {
      // No ORCA_SHELL_READY_MARKER — the existing OSC 777 barrier is POSIX-only
      // today; PowerShell startup-command panes are a separate follow-up.
    },
    supportsReadyMarker: false
  }
}
```

The existing `if (process.platform === 'win32') return` early-return in both files' `ensureShellReadyWrappers` is replaced with a conditional that still skips writing the zsh/bash wrappers on win32 but does write the `.ps1`.

Both the local and daemon shell-ready files need this same edit — another instance of the ~80% duplication called out in §Cleanups (still deferred). The duplicated edit is intentional this PR; consolidation is a follow-up.

Note: **PSReadLine is present by default in Windows PowerShell 5.1+ and PowerShell 7+**, which covers the overwhelming majority of Windows users. If PSReadLine is disabled/missing (some enterprise Windows environments do this), the drop signal does not fire — pane falls back to 30-min TTL. Acceptable for initial ship; document in release notes.

### 3. Parser: xterm.js in renderer only (Option A)

xterm.js v6 exposes `terminal.parser.registerOscHandler(oscCode, handler)`. Register a handler for code `133` at pane-creation time. Daemon-backed panes work transparently because the daemon already forwards all PTY bytes to the renderer's xterm.js. Option B (parsing in the daemon's `HeadlessEmulator`) is not chosen — renderer-only matches VS Code and requires zero daemon changes.

Implementation sketch:

```ts
// src/renderer/src/components/terminal-pane/shell-integration.ts
export function attachShellIntegration(
  terminal: Terminal,
  options: { onCommandFinished: (exitCode: number | null) => void }
): { dispose: () => void } {
  const disposables: Array<() => void> = []

  disposables.push(
    terminal.parser.registerOscHandler(133, (data) => {
      // data is the Pt portion, e.g. "A", "B", "C", "D;0", "D;130"
      const [sub, ...rest] = data.split(';')
      switch (sub) {
        case 'A':  // prompt start — parsed + consumed, no behavior wired
        case 'B':  // prompt end — parsed + consumed, no behavior wired
        case 'C':  // command executed — parsed + consumed, no behavior wired
          break
        case 'D': {
          // Command finished. Emit regardless of prior C (shells that
          // missed a preexec still fire precmd). §5 gates the drop on
          // agentStatusByPaneKey having a live entry, so spurious D fires
          // on non-agent commands are no-ops.
          const exitCode = rest[0] ? parseInt(rest[0], 10) : null
          options.onCommandFinished(Number.isNaN(exitCode as number) ? null : exitCode)
          break
        }
      }
      return true  // consume the sequence; don't let xterm render the escape
    })
  )

  return { dispose: () => disposables.forEach((d) => d()) }
}
```

`onCommandFinished` calls `removeAgentStatus(paneKey)` via the existing store action. Drop-on-exit is the ONLY OSC 133 consumer wired here — A/B/C are parsed and consumed (so they don't render) but drive no behavior.

### 4. Event flow

```
User Ctrl+Cs out of codex in a pane
    │
    ▼
Shell regains foreground, runs precmd
    │
    ▼
Wrapper script emits: \e]133;D;130\a (SIGINT → exit 130) then \e]133;A\a
    │
    ▼
Bytes travel through PTY → provider (local or daemon adapter) → renderer
    │
    ▼
xterm.js parser fires registered OSC 133 handler with "D;130"
    │
    ▼
attachShellIntegration → options.onCommandFinished(130)
    │
    ▼
If paneKey has a live agentStatus entry: dispatch removeAgentStatus(paneKey)
    │
    ▼
Dashboard row drops. Latency: ~50-150ms (OSC roundtrip + parser + React render)
```

Compare to the polling approach: 2s interval, 2 ticks to detect transition = 2-4s in the best case, relies on POSIX kernel primitive.

### 5. State: what we track, when it fires

We fire `removeAgentStatus` when **both** conditions hold at the moment `OSC 133;D` arrives:

1. The pane currently has a live `agentStatusByPaneKey` entry (otherwise there's nothing to drop).
2. That entry's `state` is one of `working | blocked | waiting` (not already `done`).

The gate check lives in the renderer call site that invokes `attachShellIntegration` (alongside the existing OSC handlers at `src/renderer/src/components/terminal-pane/pty-connection.ts`); it reads `useAppStore.getState().agentStatusByPaneKey[paneKey]` synchronously inside `onCommandFinished`.

Pure "D → drop" is fine for this PR. A third gate (requiring a recent `C` after the agent hook fired) was considered to prevent spurious drops on incidental shell commands between agent turns, but in practice the agent hook re-fires and re-populates immediately. Revisit only if user testing surfaces spurious drops.

### 6. Fallback and feature detection

If the shell does not emit OSC 133 (user has a broken `.zshrc`, unsupported shell, SSH remote without our injection, etc.), the existing 30-minute TTL + renderer decay-to-idle continues to handle the case. No new fallback path is required; this PR *removes* the tcgetpgrp polling path entirely.

Detection UI (a "shell integration inactive" banner) is a follow-up PR.

## Migration from the current branch

The poller is removed in this PR, in the same commit series as the shell integration lands. There is no overlap phase. Net diff must be negative **before** the new code lands.

### Deletion checklist

`getForegroundProcess` has non-poller callers already on `main` (`agent-ready-wait.ts`, `codex-session-restart.ts`, `new-workspace.ts`, plus the underlying `pty:getForegroundProcess` IPC handler and its tests), so this PR only removes the poller-specific additions and leaves the shared RPC surface intact.

**A. Delete (poller-specific)**
- `src/main/agent-foreground-poller.ts` + `src/main/agent-foreground-poller.test.ts`
- `src/main/index.ts` — remove the `agent-foreground-poller` import, the module-scoped `agentForegroundPoller` const, the `.stop()` call in the `closed` handler, and the `registerPaneKeyTeardownListener(...agentForegroundPoller.untrackPane...)` registration only. Leave the pre-existing `stopCursorSpinner` teardown registration intact.
- `src/preload/index.ts` — remove the `onForegroundShell` subscription binding (keep the `getForegroundProcess` invoke)
- `src/preload/index.d.ts` + `src/preload/api-types.d.ts` — remove the `onForegroundShell` typed surface (keep `getForegroundProcess`)
- `src/renderer/src/hooks/useIpcEvents.ts` — remove the `window.api.pty.onForegroundShell(...)` subscription
- `src/renderer/src/hooks/useIpcEvents.test.ts` — remove the `onForegroundShell` regression block
- The `pty:foreground-shell` IPC channel itself (main-side `webContents.send('pty:foreground-shell', ...)` and any preload `ipcRenderer.on('pty:foreground-shell', ...)`)
- Daemon surfaces this branch ADDED for the poller: new `SubprocessHandle.getForegroundProcess` method, new `Session.getForegroundProcess` method, the `daemon-server.ts` switch case that routes this RPC, the `GetForegroundProcessRequest`/`Result` types in `src/main/daemon/types.ts`, and the `pty-subprocess.ts` `getForegroundProcess` implementation (≈lines 160-175). For `DaemonPtyAdapter.getForegroundProcess`: **revert the method body to the pre-branch stub (`return null`); do NOT remove the method** — the `PtyProvider` interface member is kept per §B. Diff against `main` to confirm; delete only branch-added entries.

**B. Keep (shared RPC surface used by non-poller callers)**
- `src/main/providers/types.ts` — `PtyProvider.getForegroundProcess(id)` interface method
- `src/main/providers/local-pty-provider.ts` and `src/main/providers/ssh-pty-provider.ts` — concrete impls
- `src/main/ipc/pty.ts` — `pty:getForegroundProcess` handler registration + `removeHandler`
- `src/main/ipc/pty.test.ts` — handler tests
- `src/preload/index.ts` — `pty:getForegroundProcess` invoke binding
- `src/relay/pty-handler.ts` + `src/relay/pty-shell-utils.ts` (`getForegroundProcessName`) — used by the SSH path

**C. Verification**

```
rg -n "getForegroundProcess|pty:foreground-shell|onForegroundShell|agent-foreground-poller" src tests
```

After deletion completes, this command should return hits only in the shared-RPC surface listed in section (B). Any hit for `pty:foreground-shell`, `onForegroundShell`, or `agent-foreground-poller` means deletion is incomplete.

## Remote PTYs (SSH): known gap

The relay-backed panes (SSH remotes) send PTY data through a different path — the relay daemon on the remote host spawns node-pty and streams bytes back. Two aspects to address:

1. **Parser:** Works automatically. The renderer's xterm.js receives SSH-backed bytes identically to local bytes; the OSC handler fires the same way.
2. **Injection:** Broken by default. The relay does not currently inject our shell-ready wrappers on the remote. SSH panes run the user's unmodified `.bashrc` / `.zshrc` on the remote host.

Fixing injection for remote panes is a follow-up project, not a blocker for this design. SSH users fall back to the 30-min TTL (same as today for them — the current poller also doesn't work for SSH, because the remote PTY's foreground-process info isn't surfaced through the relay). Document in release notes.

## Rollout

### Flag: compile-time only in this PR

Shell integration ships behind the existing compile-time `AGENT_DASHBOARD_ENABLED` constant (`src/shared/constants.ts:20`). No runtime user toggle in this PR.

**Why only compile-time here:**

- `AGENT_DASHBOARD_ENABLED` already gates the entire agent-status stack — hooks, store writes, dashboard UI, sidebar sort inputs. Shell integration is just another branch inside that same gate.
- Currently hardcoded `true` for local development; nothing end-users see changes. Flip to `false` before merging to `main`, then flip to `true` when the feature is ready to be exposed to users (via the follow-up toggle PR).
- Avoids coupling this PR's scope to a user-facing settings UI change. Ship the mechanism first, add the toggle second.

### Follow-up PR: runtime toggle

A separate PR lands before `AGENT_DASHBOARD_ENABLED` flips to `true`. It adds:

- `experimentalAgentTracking: boolean` (default `false`) on `GlobalSettings`, persisted.
- A `SearchableSetting` block in `ExperimentalPane.tsx` below the daemon toggle, rendered only when `AGENT_DASHBOARD_ENABLED === true`.
- Idiomatic composition: `AGENT_DASHBOARD_ENABLED && s.settings.experimentalAgentTracking` on every existing agent-status read site.

That PR is where the toggle's read semantics (main-at-spawn for injection, renderer-at-creation for parser, new-panes-only for mid-session toggle) get specified and wired. Out of scope here.

### Ordering

1. This PR: shell integration mechanism behind `AGENT_DASHBOARD_ENABLED`, poller deleted, compile-time flag remains `true` locally, flipped `false` at merge.
2. Follow-up PR: runtime toggle lands, compile-time flag still `false`.
3. Release-ready: compile-time flag flips to `true`, toggle becomes user-visible (default off).
4. Graduation: after a clean release cycle, both gates are removed in a cleanup PR and the feature is permanent.

## Testing

### Required this PR

- **Renderer OSC 133 parser unit test:** feed synthetic OSC sequences into a mock xterm.js parser, assert `onCommandFinished` fires with the right exit code. Cover A, B, C, D, and malformed payloads.
- **zsh wrapper golden-file test:** verify the generated `.zshrc` string content.
- **PowerShell wrapper golden-file test:** verify the generated `orca-shell-integration.ps1` string content.

### Follow-ups (not in CI this round)

- Per-shell subprocess integration tests (spawn real zsh/pwsh, assert A/B/C/D appear on stdout).
- Electron e2e coverage (open pane, run `sleep 5`, Ctrl+C, assert row drops within 1s).

### Manual test matrix

| Shell | OS | Agent CLI | Expected |
|-------|----|-----------|----------|
| zsh | macOS | codex | Row drops <1s after Ctrl+C |
| zsh | macOS | claude | Same |
| zsh | macOS | gemini | Same |
| PowerShell | Windows | codex | Same |
| PowerShell | Windows | claude (via node) | Same |
| zsh | macOS, user has custom `.zshrc` with their own `precmd_functions` | codex | Row drops, user's precmd still runs |
| PowerShell | Windows, PSReadLine disabled | codex | No drop (documented gap); 30-min TTL fires |

## Risks

1. **Shell-wrapper edge cases.** Every shell has a long tail of user configs that break injection: custom `ZDOTDIR`, antigen/zinit/zplug, oh-my-posh, starship, PowerShell `$PROFILE` hooks. The existing shell-ready wrapper has already fought battles here (see the `fix-zdotdir-recursion` PR). Same class of problem; same mitigation (defensive scripting, graceful fallback to TTL).
2. **Timing of exit-code capture.** `$?` in zsh and `$LASTEXITCODE` / `$?` in PowerShell must be captured **before** any other command runs. Our `__orca_osc133_precmd` must be the first thing in the function — ordering matters. Test explicitly.
3. **Interaction with `scanForShellReady` and startup-command flush.** The existing scanner at `local-pty-shell-ready.ts:35` consumes the first `OSC 133;A` from the data stream before xterm.js sees it, but only when `ORCA_SHELL_READY_MARKER=1` (startup-command panes). After this PR, the wrapper emits `OSC 133;A` on every prompt, not just the first. Two things to verify and specify:

    **A. Who consumes which bytes.** The daemon wrapper emits `OSC 777;orca-shell-ready` instead of `OSC 133;A` (see `daemon/shell-ready.ts:84-89`). The local wrapper historically emitted `OSC 133;A` for the barrier (`local-pty-shell-ready.ts:168`). To keep the signals cleanly separated, **the local wrapper switches to `OSC 777;orca-shell-ready` for the barrier** (matching the daemon) when injecting the new per-prompt OSC 133 emission. `scanForShellReady` switches to scanning for `OSC 777` as well. After this change: the barrier scanner and the OSC 133 parser never touch the same bytes. The "claude claude" double-echo fix continues to work because the OSC 777 barrier preserves its current semantics; xterm.js parser ignores OSC 777 (no registered handler) and passes it through unconsumed — which is fine because it's an OSC escape, not printable content.

    **B. Regression test.** Add one test (inside the renderer parser unit test file) that feeds a mixed byte sequence — `OSC 777;orca-shell-ready\x07` followed by `OSC 133;A\x07` followed by shell output — into the scanner, asserts only the OSC 777 is consumed by the barrier, and confirms xterm.js parser then sees the OSC 133;A plus the shell output unchanged.
4. **PTY byte ordering.** Node-pty batches writes. An OSC 133 sequence could theoretically straddle a chunk boundary. xterm.js's parser handles this — it buffers incomplete escape sequences. Verified by the fact that VS Code uses the same parser. No action required.
5. **User hijacks our precmd.** Mitigate by appending our function inside `.zshrc`. If a user reassigns `precmd_functions=()` after our line, we lose the signal and fall back to the 30-min TTL. A follow-up PR may add a diagnostic banner when `A` is never observed.
6. **PowerShell injection overriding user profile.** Our `-Command ". '$env:ORCA_SHELL_INTEGRATION'; . $PROFILE"` invocation assumes the user's `$PROFILE` is well-behaved. Some users set `$PROFILE` to exit if non-interactive. Test against Microsoft's default profile template and document override behavior.
7. **PowerShell `-NoProfile` ordering.** `-NoProfile -NoExit -Command '... $PROFILE'` invocation means our integration loads *before* the user's `$PROFILE`. If the user's `$PROFILE` throws during load, the user sees the error but our integration still works. If the user relies on `$PROFILE` running before interactive-shell startup (rare), behavior differs from a plain pwsh launch. Document in release notes; no code change needed.

## Cleanups (opportunistic)

Deferred to follow-up PR. Consolidation of `local-pty-shell-ready.ts` + `daemon/shell-ready.ts` is explicitly out of scope here.

## Migration timeline

Rough estimate for a solo engineer on this codebase:

| Phase | Scope | Days |
|-------|-------|------|
| 1 | Delete poller + IPC plumbing (net-negative diff first) | 1 |
| 2 | Renderer OSC 133 parser, gated inside the existing `AGENT_DASHBOARD_ENABLED` branches | 1-2 |
| 3 | zsh wrapper extension + golden-file test | 1-2 |
| 4 | PowerShell wrapper + golden-file test + Windows smoke test | 2-3 |
| 5 | Dogfood hardening (Orca team on their own shells) | 1-2 |

**Working estimate: 1–2 weeks wall-clock to ship behind the compile-time flag.** The runtime user toggle is a separate follow-up PR (see §Rollout).

Target is 1–2 weeks for both zsh + PowerShell. No zsh-only fallback — PowerShell ships with this PR.

## Appendix: reference points in the two local repos

### VS Code (`/Users/thebr/source/repos/public/vscode`)

- `src/vs/platform/terminal/common/xterm/shellIntegrationAddon.ts` — the xterm.js addon. Read the `FinalTermOscPt` enum for the authoritative sequence list. The parser wiring (`_handleFinalTermSequence`) is a direct model for ours.
- `src/vs/workbench/contrib/terminal/common/scripts/shellIntegration.ps1` — PowerShell injection. Note the `Set-PSReadLineKeyHandler` patterns for Enter/Chord handling — the "simpler" version in this design may need to grow to match.
- `src/vs/workbench/contrib/terminal/common/scripts/shellIntegration-rc.zsh` — zsh injection. Notable for the `_vsc_in_command` state tracking.
- `src/vs/workbench/contrib/terminal/test/browser/xterm/shellIntegrationAddon.test.ts` — test patterns we can model our unit tests on.

### Ghostty (`/Users/thebr/source/repos/public/ghostty`)

- `src/terminal/osc/parsers/semantic_prompt.zig` — the OSC 133 parser. A good reference for *just the parse logic*.
- `src/shell-integration/zsh/.zshenv` and `src/shell-integration/zsh/ghostty-integration` — zsh injection. Uses the same `ZDOTDIR` trick we already use for shell-ready wrappers.

### Relevant files in this repo

- `src/main/providers/local-pty-shell-ready.ts` — where zsh wrappers are emitted today; extend here.
- `src/main/daemon/shell-ready.ts` — daemon-side parallel implementation; extend here (consolidation deferred).
- `src/renderer/src/components/terminal-pane/pty-connection.ts:246` — where the renderer currently handles `pty:foreground-shell`; replace with renderer-local OSC 133 handler.
- `src/main/agent-foreground-poller.ts` — to be deleted in this PR.
- `src/main/index.ts:254-282` — where the poller is instantiated and the drop IPC is sent; remove in this PR.
